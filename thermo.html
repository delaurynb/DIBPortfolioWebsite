    <h2>Design and Rapid Prototyping</h2>

    <p><b>Overview</b><br>Wi-fi thermostats, also referred to as wireless, smart, and internet thermostats, are household thermostats that allow a remote device to access and control all of the basic functions of the HVAC system. As long as a thermostat is connected to the home wifi, the mobile app will be able to connect to it and allow the user to manipulate its features. These devices give homeowners the ability to perform tasks such as increase and decrease the temperature, set temperature schedules, and monitor temperature conditions from the couch, the grocery store, the workplace, or even vacation. Wi-fi thermostats are beneficial not only because they offer convenience for the user, but because they save money for the homeowner and save energy for the environment by helping regulate temperatures within the home more efficiently.</p>
    
    <p><b>Description and Details</b><br>The goal of this project is to develop a feasible design for Tsen’s wi-fi thermostat mobile application, Thermo. I have carefully designed created a prototype to highlight the application’s four main features: onboarding, changing temperature, setting a temperature schedule, and reporting. The functionality of the app is based on a simplistic design meant to make the overall experience of the user as effortless as possible.</p>

    <p>The onboarding process of Thermo includes both a “login” and a “sign up” feature. The only difference between the original sketches and the final design of these pages is the replacement of “forgot password?” with the “Login” button on the Login screen. The information is enclosed inside of a tab-like shape to help draw that eye to the focus points of the screen and create a differentiation between the “login” and “sign up”. The Login screen appears on top first to accommodate users that have already created an account. This screen prompts users to enter their username and password and click the “Login” button in order to access the Connect To screen. The setup of the screen follows a setup that is similar to several other popular mobile applications including Google, Instagram, and Netflix, so its functionality appeals to a conceptual map that is familiar to the user. The Sign Up screen must be clicked to be accessed by new users. It prompts users to enter their first name, last name, email, and create a password so that an account can be created for them before they can move forward with the application. The tabs and buttons on the Login and Sign Up pages are rounded at the corners to create a softer, more modern look for the interface, and the color scheme is follows a mint green, white, and gray palette to represent a fresh interface for the user.</p>

    <p>Once logged in or signed up, the user will be directed to the Connect To screen. The final design of the Connect To screen is very similar to the sketch except that I created some closure around the thermostat options in order to continue the design layout of the Login and Sign Up screens. Here they can select the thermostat that they would like to operate so the application knows which device to connect to, and then they will be presented with the Home screen of the corresponding thermostat. The design of the Home screen depends primarily on the proximity of information for organization. The current temperature is the most important feature, so it is the largest and most prominent thing on the screen. The original sketch featured a sliding bar to change the temperature, but I changed it to buttons because the temperature only increments in integer values, and it is easier to establish that increment with buttons. To the right of the temperature are adjustment buttons that allow the user to immediately increase or decrease the temperature to their liking. Below the main temperature feature, the user can choose to create a temperature schedule or to view the energy summary at the bottom of the screen. The Schedule button will direct the user to the scheduling tool. This button was originally on the bottom left of the screen, but I moved it to the center to make it a more prominent feature. Similarly, the Energy Summary was going to have its own separate page, but with all of the extra space under the Schedule button in the final design, the energy summary report could comfortably fit on the bottom of the Home screen. The Energy Summary will allow the user to view details about how long their system ran throughout the day and how much energy their system has saved. </p>

            <p>The final feature of the app is the scheduling tool. It is accessed by clicking the “Schedule” button on the Homepage and features a bar at the top of the screen with all the days of the week. The user can select the day of the week by clicking on it and add components to the schedule by adjusting the time, adjusting the temperature, and pressing “Add to Schedule”. The initial sketch featured a graph that would show temperature components at different times of the day, but that could potentially get cluttered and unorganized, so in the final design the user can see that the time and temperature is added to that day’s schedule in a list at the bottom of the screen. Components will be added in chronological order. If a user wants to apply a component to every day of the week, then they can select the “apply all” button before they add it to the schedule. Once components have been added to the schedule the wi-fi thermostat will start following the updated schedule.</p>
